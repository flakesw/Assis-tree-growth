This repository contains code and data used in the analysis for the manuscript accepted in Journal of Ecology, Not all trees can make a forest: Tree species composition and competition control forest encroachment in a tropical savanna, by Samuel W. Flake, Eliane Honda, Natashi Pilon, Giselda Durigan, and William A. Hoffmann. 

All data processing, analysis, and figure creation are done in one script (assis_growth_all_trees_with_height_analysis.R). Inputs are tree-level data, plot-level data, and soils data. For details of data collection, see Assis et al. 2011 and Honda & Durigan 2016. 

These data are supplied to support the publication mentioned above. If you are interested in using the data for a new analysis, please contact Giselda Durigan at giselda.durigan@gmail.com.
